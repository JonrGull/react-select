# React-Select

A quick and easy way to add a select box to your React app. There are Single and Multiple sections to choose from.

## Technology used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Changes I made

- Overhauled the CSS by using Sass a bit and added a few more variables to make it easier read. Repeating similar class names can make it easy to make mistakes. Therefore, I think Sass does a wonderful job of nesting similar named classes so you can just add onto the parents.
- I cleaned up the code a bit and added comments to help me understand what was going on.

I followed along with
[Followed Web Dev Simplified's tutorial](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/react-select) to learn more about React and how others structure their projects.

## What I learned

- This was my first time using Vite! I really liked it and it wasn't hard to use at all.
- I used this as an opportunity to learn more about Sass and how to use it in React as I have never used CSS modules and Sass together. It was much easier than I expected. It results in a very clean and easy to work with format.
- A few new shortcuts for React such as using the &times to create a close button.
- Using types within other types.
- Learned a bit more how to style components and how to make it look appealing.
- Always good to see how other people structure their code and how they use React.
